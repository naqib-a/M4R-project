    "## Part 1. Characterisation of stochastic mathematical models of the time behaviour of  spatially homogenous chemical systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The *stochastic approach* or framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The time evolution is regarded as a kind of random-walk process. (A *deterministic model*, in contrast, regards the time evolution as a continuous, wholly predictable process.)\n",
    "2. The time evolution of the system is governed by differential-difference equations called “master equations” or is computationally calculated exactly by the Gillespie algorithm. (In a *deterministic model*, the time evolution of the system is governed by a set of coupled, ordinary differential equations called the “reaction-rate equations”.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasoning behind the stochastic framework\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The time evolution of a chemically reacting system is not a continuous process, because molecular population levels obviously can change only by discrete integer amounts. \n",
    "2. The time evolution is not a deterministic process, for, the molecular motions are regarded to be governed by the equations of classical mechanics, it is impossible to predict the exact molecular population levels at some future time, unless we take account of the precise positions and velocities of all the molecules in the system. In other words, although the temporal behavior of a chemically reacting system of classical molecules is a deterministic process in the full position-momentum phase space of the system, it is not a deterministic process in the N-dimensional subspace of the species population numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification of stochastic models as mathematical models\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The stochastic model is linear (not nonlinear)** - because chemical reactions exihibit linear relationships between the reactants. For example, an enzymatic reaction \n",
    "    \n",
    "    S + E <-> SE -> E + P\n",
    "    \n",
    "is broken down into\n",
    "\n",
    "    S + E -> SE\n",
    "    SE -> S + E\n",
    "    SE -> E + P\n",
    "    \n",
    "which all have linear relations between the reactants and products. Note that a linear model does not necessarily predic non-linear expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stochastic models are dynamic (not static i.e. time-invariant)** -  because they accounts for time-dependent changes in the state of the system. (A *static model* calculates the system in equillibrium. An example is Flux Balance Analysis of metabolic models using linear programming).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stochastic models are explicit** -  all of the input parameters of the overall model are known, and the output parameters can be calculated by a finite series of computations \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stochastic models are not always discrete** - a discrete model is one where objects are treated as discrete entities. (A *continuous model* represents the objects in a continuous manner, for example, chemical reactions can be regarded as a continuous rate processes). Chemical master equations do not need to be discrete, as they describe probabilites; in simple cases it might be even possible to solve them without simulation algorithms e.g to calculate probabilities of system states as function of times. Discrete event simulations, such as the Gillespie algorithm, represent just one way (most useful practically) to solve chemical master equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stochastic models are probabilistic and not deterministic** - randomness is included in the model in order to capture inherent fluctuations in the molecular population levels. Therefore variable states are described by probability distributions and these models can perform differently for the same set of initial conditions. (A deterministic model is one where the variable states are uniquely determined by parameters in the model and by sets of previous states of these variables. Therefore, a deterministic model always performs the same way for a given set of initial conditions.)"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modelling the system stochastically - Translating of the problem into stochastic language \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions of the stochastic framework\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A fixed volume `V` \n",
    "2. `V` contains a spatially uniform mixture of `N` chemical species\n",
    "3. The chemical species are in thermal (but not necessarily chemical) equilibrium, which means that collisions occur in an essentially random manner.\n",
    "3. A chemical reaction occurs whenever two or more molecules of \"appropriate kinds\" (defined by the reaction equations) collide in an \"appropriate way\" (assuming that the two molecules `S1` and `S2` are hard spheres of radii `rl` and `r2`, a collision will occur between them whenever the center-to-center distance between the two molecules decreases to `r12= r1 + r2`). \n",
    "4. All collisions are reactive, i.e. they result in chemical alterations of the colliding molecules as defined by the reaction equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A simple chemical system modelled stochastically is characterised by a \"collision/reaction probability per unit time\" (i.e. it is a stochastic Markov process) and not by a \"collision rate\" (i.e. a deterministic rate process)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Side note:** A stochastic Markov process is one that satisfies the so called *Markov property*, which says that the conditional probability distribution of future states of a process depends only upon the present state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have two molecules `S1` and `S2`. Whilst we cannot rigorously calculate *the number of collisions* between `S1` and `S2`, occurring in `V` in any infinitesimal time interval, we can rigorously calculate *the probability of a collision* occurring between `S1` and `S2`, in `V` in any infinitesimal time interval:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculating the propensity of each reaction (the collision/reaction probability per unit time)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with an **example**. Suppose the `S1` and `S2` molecules in `V` can undergo the reaction\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "R1: S1 + S2 -> 2S1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we may assert the existence of a constant `cl`, which depends only on the physical properties of the two molecules and the temperature of the system, such that `c1*dt` is *the average probability that a particular `S1-S2` molecular pair will react according to `R1` in the next infinitesimal time interval `dt`*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that, if at time `t` there are `X1` of the `S1` molecules and `X2` of the `S2` molecules, making a total of `h1 = Xl*X2` distinct `S1-S2` pairs. Let `a1=h1*c1` then `a1*dt` is *the probability that an `R1` reaction will occur somewhere inside `V` in the next infinitesimal time interval `(t, t + dt)`*.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"diag.png\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us take another example. Consider the reverse of the reaction of `R1`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "R2: 2S1 -> S1 + S2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we would characterize this reaction by a constant `c2`, such that `c2*dt` is the average probability that a particular pair of `S1` molecules will react according to `R2` in the next `dt`. However, the number of distinct pairs of `S1` molecules in `V` is not `X1*X1` but `h2 = X1*(X1-1)/2!`. . Let `a2=h2*c2`. Hence, the probability that an `R2` reaction will occur somewhere inside `V` in the next time interval `dt` is `a2*dt`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for the **general form**, suppose the volume `V` contains a mixture of `Xj` molecules of chemical species `Sj (j = 1, ..., N)` and suppose further that these `N` species can interreact through `M` specified chemical reaction channels `Ri (i = 1, ..., M)`. Then we may assert the existence of `M` constants `ci (i =  1, ..., M)`, which depend only on the physical properties of the molecules and the temperature of the system, such that `ci*dt` is the *the average probability that a particular combination of `Ri` reactant molecules will react accordingly in the next infinitesimal time interval dt*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let `hi` be the total number of distinct combinations of `R_i` reactant molecules in `V` at time `t` (a simple algebraic expression calculated using the binomial coefficient of the stoichiometry of the reactants). Then, if we multiply `ci*dt` by `hi`, we will obtain the probability `ai*dt` (where `ai=hi*ci`) that an `Ri` reaction will occur somewhere inside `V` in the next infinitesimal time interval `(t, t + dt)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary**:\n",
    "- *the propensity of a reaction* `Ri (i = 1, ..., M)` is governed solely by the fundamental hypothesis that, for  constants `ci`, which depends only on the physical properties of the reactants of `Ri`, `ci*dt` is *the average probability that the particular combination of `Ri` reactant molecules will react in the next infinitesimal time interval dt*. \n",
    "- furthermore, the probability of reaction `Ri` happening in the next time interval `(t, t + dt)` is calculated as the product `hi` of the total number of distinct combinations of `Ri` reactant molecules and `ci*dt`, i.e. `ai*dt` for `ai=hi*ci`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: `ci` is called the **stochastic rate constant**.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> (AH) Very important practical point. Here or later you should provide a way to convert  between stochastic (ci) and deterministic (ci) rate constants. And illustrate it with examples.\n",
    "Show how to make these calculations for 0, 1st, 2nd and higher order reactions.\n",
    "Because in literature deterministic rate constants are normally shown. So one would need it to run stochastic simulations with given deterministic rates and to compare stoshastic simulations to ODE solutions. If needed, you can check our paper (Halavatyi, A.A., Nazarov, P.V., Medves, S., van Troys, M., Ampe, C., Yatskou, M., and Friederich, E. (2009). An integrative simulation model linking major biochemical reactions of actin-polymerization to structural properties of actin filaments. Biophys Chem 140, 24-34.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculating the time evolution of the system (that is modelled stochastically)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us consider how to sample the time evolution of this system in a way that follows the probability density function of the Chemical Master Equation. Remember that the system is a Markov process, so it is enough to base the argument on the current state of the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we are given that the system is in the state `(X1,...,XN)` at time `t`,  essentially all we need in order to “move the system forward in time” is to answer these two questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. when will the next reaction occur, and \n",
    "2. what kind of reaction will it be \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(**Side note on probability disctributions and sampling or drawing from them:** Suppose we have a data generating process, for example, the throwing of a dice. So long as the dice is fair, we know that we will only get numbers 1-6 and that each number has the same probablility as the others. This describes the probability distribution. Now, to draw or sample from the distribution means to throw the dice and record the outcome; we know the outcome has a specific probability, but we can not predict what the outcome will be. Eventually, after you have sampled enough, you can calculate numbers such as the mean (or expected value), the varialce, the quatiles and use these numbers to characterise the distribution. In this case, it is easy to see that the dice follows a uniform distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can have a similar example with the heights of the people in the room, try it!)\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to obtain the next time `T` and reaction `mu`, could be to draw two random numbers `r1` and `r2` from the uniform distribution and to use them to calculate the next time and reaction with the following formulas:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"c2.png\" style=\"width: 180px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"a0.png\" style=\"width: 350px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"a.png\" style=\"width: 100px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that this relies on the propensities of the reactions that we calculated just above; in other words, the next reaction and time are influenced by the propencities of the reactions, but this make sense, since a reaction with a higher propensity should have a higher probabilty of happening than one with a lower propensity.)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is shown in Gillespie's paper that choosing the next time and reaction in this way, samples directly from the *probability density function* that is the Chemical Master Equation. (Note that this probability density function is a joint probability density function (also knows as a probability measure) of the continuous variable T (0<= T < inf), for the time of the next reaction, and the discrete variable (mu = 1, 2,. ..,M).)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in practice, according to the calculations we have made above, of the reation propensities and the next time and reaction, to simulate a stochastic model of any simple chemical system you can just follow this algorithm (the Gillespie algorithm) below:\n",
    "\n",

    "Additionally, to be able to visualise the output of every loop, we will also want to provide an automated way of storing the changing values of the reactants, rather than doing it by hand as we did above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is always a good practice to implement a debugging strategy. We recommend defining a *pause* function that will ask the user (of the program) to press the `<ENTER>` key to continue and to print values that will help the user keep track of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement these new changes, let's use a new biochemical system, that has more than one reaction. It is important that this system has more than one reaction because if you can write a program general enough to deal with more than one reaction, then there should be no problem with a system with more reactions. Let's use the following system:\n",

    "R1: 2X1 + X2 -> X3\n",
    "R2: X1 -> 0\n",
    "```\n",

    "(**Note on how to represent this system of chemical equations in matrix form:** \n",
    "We can write any system on chemical equations in matrix form. First we choose a convention, for example, the rows of the matrix correspond to the reactions and the columns to the reactants. Next, we read off the effect that the reactions have on each of the reactants, for example, R1 consumes 2 (molecules) of X1 and 1 of X2 and produces 1 of X3. Finally, we recod these numbers i correcsponding matrix entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the example above, the array form for the system above would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    X1 X2 X3\n",
    "R1  -2 -1  1\n",
    "R2  -1  0  0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also choose to write the stoichiometry of the substrates and producs, which which case you only take into account how the substrates/products are affected. So for example, the substrate stoichiometry array of the system above would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    X1 X2 X3\n",
    "R1  -2 -1  0\n",
    "R2  -1  0  0\n",

    "### Stochastic vs deterministic\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably the bext thing you can try to do it to compare the results of these stochastic simulations with results you would get when you model the same systems deterministically, with a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). This will actually validate our stochastic simulation algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that ODE modelling is performed in terms of concentrations and deterministic rate constants; and stochastic calculations are in stochastic constants and molecule numbers. So for the results to be comparable, we need to make conversions properly. Luckily, Gillespie spells this out for us in his paper and if you are interested, you can have a look at page 2343, section IIC. Connection with the Deterministic Reaction-Rate Constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the stochastic reaction rate constant is `c_i`, which we introduced in Part 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's denote the deterministic rate constant for reaction `R_i` with `k_i`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conclusion of Gillespie's analysis is that \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "k_i = (V^(m-1))*c_i\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of the factor `V^(m-1)`, where `m` is the number of reactant molecules in reaction `R_i`, is merely a consequence of the fact that the reaction-rate constant is normally used in differential equations that contain molecular concentrations (numbers of molecules per unit volume) rather than total numbers of molecules. For example, if reaction `R_i` had three reactant molecules, we would have `V^2` instead of `V`;if `R_i`had only one reactant molecule (a simple isomerization), the factor `V` would be absent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, in general, if `R`, has `n` identical reactant molecules, then `c` will be larger than `k` by a factor of `n!`. So, for example, if we have `R: 2X1 -> X2` then `k=V*c/2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's translate the following system and simulate it deterministically (if you need to learn this topic or prefresh your memory, we refer you to [this](https://github.com/karinsasaki/biomath-modelling-with-python) tutorial):\n",
    "```\n",
    "R1: D -> D + R\n",
    "R2: R -> R + P\n",
    "R3: R -> 0\n",
    "R4: P -> 0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We had defined the stochastic rate constants as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "c1 = 0.01\n",
    "c2 = 0.1\n",
    "c3 = 0.0001\n",
    "c4 = 0.0001\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume the volume of the system is 1, then the deterministic rate constants are:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "k1 = 0.01\n",
    "k2 = 0.1\n",
    "k2 = 0.0001\n",
    "k2 = 0.0001\n",
    "```\n",
