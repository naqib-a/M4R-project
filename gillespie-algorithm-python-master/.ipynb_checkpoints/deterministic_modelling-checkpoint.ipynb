    "\n",
    "The specific forms of the functions f_i are determined by the structures and rate constants of the M chemical reaction channels, and are called the *reaction-rate equations*. Solving them for the X_i(t), subject to the prescribed initial conditions, is tantamount to solving the time-evolution problem posed earlier. Reliably solving reaction-rate equations on a computer is simple and can be learned from the tutorial on \"deterministic models of biochemical reactions\"."
